A comprehensive data science project analyzing representation patterns in public law enforcement datasets to identify potential biases and skews across categories, geography, and time. **Features advanced weapons analysis in serious crimes.**

![Dashboard Preview](docs/dashboard-preview.png)

## 🎯 Project Overview

This system analyzes public law enforcement data to identify patterns in representation across:
- **🗺️ Geographic distribution**: Regional skews in wanted notices vs population
- **📈 Crime categories**: Representation of different offense types over time  
- **⏰ Temporal trends**: How patterns change across years/quarters
- **🔄 Case persistence**: Duration patterns by category
- **🔫 Weapons analysis**: Weapon usage patterns in serious crimes *(NEW)*

## 🚀 Key Features

### Core Analysis
- **Statistical bias detection** using chi-square tests and trend analysis
- **Automated data ingestion** from multiple public APIs
- **Feature engineering** with geographic, temporal, and categorical analysis
- **Interactive visualizations** with filtering and drill-down capabilities

### Weapons Analysis (Advanced Feature)
- **🔫 Weapon categorization**: firearm, knife, blunt_object, none, unknown, other
- **🚨 Serious crime detection**: Flags violent crimes (homicide, assault, robbery, etc.)
- **📊 Statistical analysis**: Distribution, trends, and data quality metrics
- **🗺️ Regional patterns**: Geographic weapon usage analysis
- **⏰ Temporal trends**: Weapon usage changes over time

### Ethical Framework
- ✅ **Aggregate-only analysis** - No individual tracking or deanonymization
- ✅ **No tactical insights** - Avoids operational intelligence
- ✅ **Privacy protection** - Maintains ethical boundaries
- ✅ **Transparency** - Clear methodology and limitations

## 📊 Data Sources

- **FBI Wanted API**: Public wanted persons data
- **FBI Crime Data Explorer**: Reported crime statistics  
- **City Open Data**: Local police department datasets (LAPD, Pittsburgh, Atlanta)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, pandas, requests, scipy, statsmodels
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/DuckDB
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Streamlit, Altair
- **APIs**: FBI Wanted, FBI CDE, city open data portals

## 📈 Sample Results

From analysis of 1,000 sample records:
- **Geographic bias detected**: CA (22.1%), TX (15.8%), FL (11.7%) - Chi-square p=0.0001
- **489 serious crimes identified** (48.9% of dataset)
- **Weapon distribution**: Firearm (55.6%), Knife (23.7%), Unknown (20.7%)
- **Data quality insight**: 20.7% unknown weapon information indicates reporting gaps

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash

## 📱 Dashboard Features

- **📊 Overview**: Dataset summary and key metrics
- **🗺️ Geographic Analysis**: State representation vs population with bias detection
- **📈 Category Analysis**: Crime type distribution patterns
- **⏰ Temporal Trends**: Changes over time with correlation analysis
- **🔫 Weapons Analysis**: Weapon patterns in serious crimes *(Featured)*
- **📋 Statistical Results**: Comprehensive hypothesis test results

### Interactive Controls
- Year range filtering
- Region selection
- Serious crimes toggle
- Comparative analysis options
- Data refresh and cache clearing

## 🔬 Research Questions Addressed

1. Are certain crime types overrepresented in public notices vs reported crime stats?
2. Do regional patterns show geographic bias in wanted list visibility?
3. How have category distributions changed over time?
4. What factors influence case persistence on public lists?
5. **What weapon patterns exist in serious crimes?** *(NEW)*
6. **How does weapon information completeness vary over time and region?** *(NEW)*

## 📊 Statistical Methods

- **Geographic Analysis**: Chi-square goodness of fit test
- **Category Analysis**: Chi-square test of independence  
- **Temporal Analysis**: Pearson correlation analysis
- **Persistence Analysis**: One-way ANOVA
- **Weapons Analysis**: Distribution analysis with data quality metrics

## 🔒 Ethical Constraints

### What We DON'T Do
- ❌ Individual-level tracking or predictions
- ❌ Tactical or operational insights
- ❌ Deanonymization of public records
- ❌ Profiling or targeting recommendations

### What We DO
- ✅ Aggregate statistical analysis only
- ✅ Transparency and accountability research
- ✅ Data quality assessment
- ✅ Policy-relevant insights
- ✅ Clear limitation documentation
